### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natasha Adam and you are currently on my GitHub profile.

I currently attend Western Sydney University with a degree in Business, majoring in Economics and Property.

I have a peaked interest in Programming languages and Software Development and have been doing so since I was 13.

I currently have developed a lot of different kinds of applications and websites. You can view all the source code by going through my Repositories. 

If you want to see all my websites LIVE, you can do that by going on my portfolio https://natashaadam123.github.io and going to the 'Portfolio' section!

Feel free to reach out to me on any of these platforms:
