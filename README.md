### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natasha Adam and you are currently on my GitHub profile.

I currently attend Western Sydney University with a degree in Business, majoring in Economics and Property.

I have a peaked interest in Programming languages and Software Development and have been doing so since I was 13.

I currently have uploaded:
  - A blog template (feel free to use for whatever you like by downloading the zip file!)
  - An e-portfolio (attached is my resume, LinkedIn account and email address!)
  - A chat-app which is my current project and I am about 75% complete.

Feel free to reach out to me on any of these platforms:
